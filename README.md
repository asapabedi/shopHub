### Why ShopHub?

I asked the same question myself, but then i realized there is no ShopHub any where, (Maybe there is LOL) all there is, is just something close, like Shopify, Wix, Squareup, and countless others. Technically ShopHub is a Personalized shop for business all around the world, with Regions as a factor to display contents.
